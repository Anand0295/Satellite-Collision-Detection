## Project Overview

The increasing number of satellites and space debris in Earth's orbit creates significant collision risks, threatening valuable space assets and missions. This project aims to develop an advanced satellite collision detection and avoidance system that leverages state-of-the-art machine learning, physics-based modeling, and scalable cloud infrastructure for accurate, real-time prediction and mitigation of on-orbit collisions.

Building upon foundational work such as Erik Cupsaâ€™s collision predictor, this improved system incorporates diverse sensor and telemetry data, advanced ML models, dynamic maneuver optimization, augmented reality visualization, and multi-agency collaboration features to enhance satellite safety in an increasingly crowded orbital environment.

## Problem Statement

With hundreds of active satellites and thousands of defunct objects orbiting Earth, orbital congestion and collision probability continue to escalate. Current collision detection methods often rely on limited data and simple predictive models, which may miss nuanced interactions or generate false alarms. Additionally, satellite operators lack unified, real-time tools to assess collision risks and execute optimal avoidance maneuvers, particularly during unpredictable orbital dynamics or rapid trajectory changes.

This project addresses these challenges by developing a comprehensive system that:

- Provides accurate, timely collision predictions using enriched datasets and advanced AI.
- Plans optimal, fuel-efficient avoidance maneuvers minimizing mission disruption.
- Offers intuitive 3D and augmented reality visualizations for operator situational awareness.
- Supports scalable real-time processing and multi-stakeholder data integration.
- Enhances trustability through explainable AI and transparent decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Source Data Fusion:** Combines radar, optical tracking, telemetry, and debris catalogs to produce a detailed orbital environment model.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Models:** Employs deep learning (LSTM, GNN) and physics-informed models for dynamic collision risk prediction.
- **Optimized Maneuver Planning:** Implements multi-objective optimizers balancing collision risk reduction, fuel consumption, and mission goals.
- **Real-Time Scalable Processing:** Utilizes cloud infrastructure and streaming technologies for continuous monitoring of thousands of objects.
- **3D & AR Visualization:** Interactive dashboards and augmented reality views enable enhanced operator understanding and faster decisions.
- **Federated Data Sharing:** Secures and standardizes data exchange protocols across agencies and commercial operators.
- **Explainable AI:** Provides interpretable predictions and alerts to build operator trust and support regulatory compliance.
